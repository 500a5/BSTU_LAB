Notices:
-------
* This module is still a work in progress, I plan to more features in the future but please don't expect quick updates as I have college work, personal life and other projects I work on at the same time as this one.
* This module was designed to be used with Pillow (the fork of PIL) and not the original PIL module, chances are this module will not work with it.
* This module was designed for Pillow 8.2.0 but may work with older/newer versions, use at your own risk however.
