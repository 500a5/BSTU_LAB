MAKECIMP.EXE
------------
The utility MAKECIMP.EXE is designed to use a list of names that are EXPORTED
from a DLL using the C calling convention. Normally you would use DUMPBIN
or DUMPPE to get the list of exported functions from the DLL and then create
a file that is formatted to one name for each line.

Function1
Function2
Function3 etc ....

There should be no other data in this file except function EXPORT names.

Name the file to reflect the LIBRARY and INCLUDE file name that you require.

If the DLL that has the EXPORTED functions is called MYDLL.DLL you would
normally make a file called MYDLL.TXT that has all of the EXPORTS required
for the LIBRARY and INCLUDE files. MAKECIMP.EXE will then create two files
that have the names MYDLL.INC and MYDLL.LIB.

The text file "msvcrt.txt" is supplied as an example and it has been
derived from the Win2k sp4 version of msvcrt.dll.

Note that MAKECIMP prepends "crt_" to the function names in the generated
INCLUDE file which reflects its original task of converting the "msvcrt"
DLL. If you need otherwise, use GLOBAL replace in a text editor for the
INCLUDE file to change this prepended text to whatever form you require.
