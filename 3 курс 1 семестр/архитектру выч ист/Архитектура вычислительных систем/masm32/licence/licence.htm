<b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+3>The MASM32 Project
Licence</font></font></tt></b>
<p><tt>The MASM32 project is licenced freeware available to any programmer
who wishes to either learn or write 32 bit Microsoft Assembler. All of
the software in the MASM32 project is copyright (c) software that cannot
be purchased, sold, re-licenced, attached or bundled with any form of software
whatsoever.</tt>
<p><tt>This licence for the MASM32 Project supersedes all earlier versions
of the licence. This licence is dated the <b><u>28th of December 2004</u></b>

<p><b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+1>Licence Compliance.</font></font></tt></b>
<br><tt>The MASM32 licence affords the user a range of rights in producing
and distributing code that the user has written using the project. To obtain
these rights, the user must be willing to fully comply with the MASM32

the software contained in the project or the authors of any binaries or
source code in the project subject to any form of legal liability for any
problems, lack of suitability, damage or financial loss that arises from
use of software written using this project. Any problems that arise with
use of software created with the MASM32 project must be taken up with the

and has no right to use it.</tt>
<p><b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+1>Definition of illegal software.</font></font></tt></b>
<br><tt>The MASM32 project is legal mainstream software and cannot be used
to create any form of illegal software whatsoever. The definition of "<b><u>illegal

your private property with unconditional rights of ownership.</tt>
<br><tt><b>2</b>. You have the non-exclusive right to include assembled/compiled

using the MASM32 Project. The same definition applies to building applications

<p><tt>If it suits your requirement you may acknowledge that the software

<p><b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+1>Why is the MASM32 Project
licenced in this manner ?</font></font></tt></b>
<br><tt>From its origin in 1998, the MASM32 Project has been subject to
many attempts to compromise its <b><u><font color="#66FFFF">true freeware
status</font></u></b> and this extends to attempts to commercialise the
project, plaigarise parts of its content for resale and attempts to absorb
it under alternative and incompatible licencing systems that restrict the
rights of the user of the project. To protect the project from any of the
attempts to compromise its integrity, it is <b><u><font color="#66FFFF">Copyright
(c)</font></u></b> software that cannot be exploited in any of the mentioned
methods.</tt>
<p><tt>The MASM32 Project is true freeware written <b><u><font color="#66FFFF">by
programmers for programmers</font></u></b> so that they can realise the
full power of the Windows Operating System without being subject to any
additional conditions or external interests. The project has been designed
as <b><u><font color="#66FFFF">enabling technology</font></u></b> to extend
the capacity and range of programmers interested in learning and writing
Microsoft assembler for Microsoft Operating Systems.</tt>
<p><b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+1>Independent and exclusive
licence for the MASM32 project.</font></font></tt></b>
<br><tt>The licence for the MASM32 project is a completely frestanding
and independent licence that is not subject to any other form of external
licence whatsoever. The licence for the MASM32 project cannot be modified,
re-licenced or absorbed under any other licencing system whatsoever and
functions to the exclusion of any other form of external licence.</tt>
<p><b><tt><font color="#66FFFF"><font size=+1>Exclusion of open source
projects and software.</font></font></tt></b>
<br><tt>The MASM32 project <b><u><font color="#66FFFF">cannot be used to
create open source software</font></u></b> or any other project under any
form of licence that requires the user of the MASM32 project to surrender
the rights they are afforded under the MASM32 licence. In particular the
MASM32 licence completely excludes projects licenced under the GNU organisation's
published
<b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GPL</a></b>
licence and/or variants.</tt>
